## Short description

### What's the problem?

You, me and others are single individuals in the world. The world is conquered and attacked by Corona virus nowadays. How can you help me and vice versa? How can we help others to fight against it? 
One of the biggest problem in Covid19 nowadays is the how we idenfity the infected people to do better social instance. Furthermore, the infected people also don't want to spread the virus to others. But how can they notice to others but still keep their health status secure?

### How can technology help?

WeCare came to be 1 of the weapons we can use now. It is a platform where small entities gather together to contribute ANONYMOUSLY. It helps users to see other people around him/her with their health status ON MAP in real time. Therefore, it helps people keep good social distance. It bases on each individual VOLUNTEER to update his/her health status. And it fully respects privacy. User does not need to reveal any personal information, even an email. 

### The idea
User share his/her health status to others voluteerily with hope others also share back too.
The WeCare mobile app displays a Map to show position of other people around user with their health indicators. There are 3 levels of Covid19 infection: 
-	exposed to someone who tested positive, 
-	who have symptoms (fever, upper respiratory)
-	have tested positive for COVID-19
Based on this information, user may decide where to go to conduct social distancing. User input his/her health status (update to 1 from above 3 health levels) voluntarily with minimum personal information. Actually, nothing more than an email needed to start using this app. No cellphone nor real name, address…needed.  
User may create a Group or join other Groups. (Group means a group of users who share the same interest. For example, Group may be a company, a community or a group of families. Members in Group can see others personal information (email, name …). Member can send message to Group and give items to others.
