## Short description

### What's the problem?

You, me and others are single individuals in the world. The world is conquered and attacked by Corona virus nowadays. How can you help me and vice versa? How can we help others to fight against it? 
One of the biggest problem in Covid19 nowadays is the how we idenfity the infected people to do better social instance. Furthermore, the infected people also don't want to spread the virus to others. But how can they notice to others but still keep their health status secure?

### How can technology help?

WeCare came to be 1 of the weapons we can use now. It is a platform where small entities gather together to contribute ANONYMOUSLY. It helps users to see other people around him/her with their health status ON MAP in real time. Therefore, it helps people keep good social distance. It bases on each individual VOLUNTEER to update his/her health status. And it fully respects privacy. User does not need to reveal any personal information, even an email.
